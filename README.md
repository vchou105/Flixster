### Notes

Flix Part 2 was relatively easier than Part 1, but when I tried making additional stories like adding rounded corners for the images using Glide transformations, I followed the instructions and implemented the corresponding dependencies, but couldn't see how I could change from using Glide to GlideApp. Other than this additional story I attempted to make, I did not encounter any challenges while building this app.

## Flix Part 1

### User Stories
#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [x] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Only major challenge was getting the list of movies to show up when I'm scrolling down then for movies on top of the list to appear again when I scroll back up.
I'm not sure why there is such a lag but it is still a concern I have when trying to build the app smoothly.
